  <h1>Matrimonial Profile</h1>
  
  <p><strong>Family Background:</strong> We are an upper-middle-class, nuclear family with moderate values. Our daughter recently completed her Master’s degree and is currently working as a Data Engineer in Dallas, TX, USA.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Marital History:</strong> She had a brief, mutually respectful marriage that lasted a few months.</p>

  <p><strong>In Her Words:</strong><br>
  “I’m seeking a partner who is emotionally available, well-settled, and values family and the institution of marriage. I believe in commitment, mutual respect, and building a strong foundation together. Let’s create a meaningful journey rooted in understanding and shared values.”
